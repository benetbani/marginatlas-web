/**
 * verify_archetype_copy , the browser-free half of the archetype harness, so it
 * can sit in the prebuild chain (no network, no secret, no browser).
 *
 * For EVERY country the taxonomy lists it builds the answer card's facts and
 * checks the copy and the promises:
 *  REGISTER: no banned corporate word in any label, note or subtitle (founder
 *    ruling 11 of 2026-09-04).
 *  LABELS: a label is four words or fewer; a note is one plain line under 48
 *    characters.
 *  PROMISE: the subtitle names registration only when the registration cost
 *    cell resolves; it names the answer only when the answer resolves.
 *  NO EMPTY SLOT: no cell carries an empty value.
 *  TAG: a modelled answer is marked modelled, so the card tags it.
 *  PAY: every country's pay pair is withheld exactly when the average is
 *    under 110 percent of the minimum, the words are the founder's, and no
 *    figure exceeds the world's highest.
 *  DOORS: every country's terminus holds at most three doors, one pill,
 *    distinct first words, no "with Pro", and every href resolves to a route
 *    in the app folder (route groups dropped, [params] matched).
 *  NOTES: every authored note list holds at most five notes, a label of at
 *    most seven words and a fact of at most 140 characters, no banned word.
 * BLIND SPOT: it cannot see a wrap or a hole; the browser half does that.
