/**
 * THE COPY TABLE for the archetypes. Every label, note and basis line the
 * archetypes print lives here, once, in the founder's register: practical and
 * direct, never corporate or institutional (his ruling 11 of 2026-09-04; the
 * rejected example was "x7.7 prime street against the edge of town, rent a
 * square metre a year"). A label is a noun phrase of four words or fewer; a
 * note is one plain line that qualifies its figure and never retracts it.
 *
 * Words the founder ruled verbatim are marked. A page never types a label of
 * its own; it takes it from here, so a ruling changes one line and every
 * instance follows. Constraint-safe: no em-dashes, no source-agency names.
